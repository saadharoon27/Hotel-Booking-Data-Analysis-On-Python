## Business Problem
In recent years, **City Hotel** and **Resort Hotel** have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is facing a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than-ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue and offer thorough business advice to address this problem. <br>

The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.

## Project Assumptions

- **No unusual occurrences** between 2015 and 2017 will have a substantial impact on the data used.
- The information is still current and can be used to analyze a hotelâ€™s possible plans in an efficient manner.
- There are **no unanticipated negatives** to the hotel employing any advised technique.
- The hotels are not currently using any of the suggested solutions.
- The **biggest factor** affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking cancellations.
- Cancellations result in **vacant rooms** for the booked length of time.
- Clients make hotel reservations the same year they make cancellations.

## Research Questions
**1.** _What are the variables that affect hotel reservations cancellations?_ <br>
**2.** _How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?_ <br>
**3.** _How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?_

## Hypothesis
**1.** _More cancellations occur when prices are higher._ <br>
**2.** _The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations._
